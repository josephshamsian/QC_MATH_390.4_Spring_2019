We now move on to simple linear modeling using the ordinary least squares algorithm.

Let's quickly recreate the sample data set from practice lecture 7:

```{r} 
n = 20 #could be on test
x = runif(n)

beta_0 = 3
beta_1 = -2
y = beta_0 + beta_1 * x + rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 0.33)


```

Solve for the least squares line by computing $b_0$ and $b_1$ _without_ using the functions `mean`, `cor`, `cov`, `var`, `sd` but instead computing it from the $x$ and $y$ quantities manually using base function such as `sum` and other basic operators. See the class notes.

```{r}
#TO-DO
x_Savg = sum(x)/n
y_Savg = sum(y)/n


b_1 = ( sum(x*y) - n * x_Savg * y_Savg ) / (sum(x^2) - n * x_Savg^2)
b_0 = y_Savg - b_1 * x_Savg
b_1
b_0
```

Verify your computations are correct using the `lm` function in R:

```{r}
lm_mod = lm( y ~ x)
b_vec = coef(lm_mod)
pacman::p_load(testthat)
expect_equal(b_0, as.numeric(b_vec[1]), tol = 1e-4)
expect_equal(b_1, as.numeric(b_vec[2]), tol = 1e-4)
```

6. We are now going to repeat one of the first linear model building exercises in history --- that of Sir Francis Galton in 1886. First load up package `HistData`.

```{r}
#TO-DO
if (!require("pacman")){install.packages("pacman")}
pacman::p_load(HistData)
```

In it, there is a dataset called `Galton`. Load it up.

```{r}
#TO-DO

Xy = data("Galton")
head()
```

You now should have a data frame in your workspace called `Galton`. Summarize this data frame and write a few sentences about what you see. Make sure you report $n$, $p$ and a bit about what the columns represent and how the data was measured. See the help file `?Galton`.

```{r}
#TO-DO
summary(Galton)
?Galton
str(Galton)
#parent height is average of their father and mother.
#height of child. 
#n = 928 oberservation in his data set. 
#p = 2
```

TO-DO

Find the average height (include both parents and children in this computation).

```{r}
n = 928
avg_height =( (sum(Galton$parent) * 2)+ sum(Galton$child ) )/ (n*3)

avg_height
```

If you were to use the null model, what would the RMSE be of this model be?

```{r}
n = 928
null = mean(Galton$child)
null

y = Galton$child
x = Galton$parent
simple_linear_model = lm(y ~ x)
simple_linear_model
b_vec = coef(simple_linear_model)
b_0 = b_vec[1]
b_1 = b_vec[2]

e =simple_linear_model$residuals
SSE = sum(e^2)
MSE = SSE/(n - 2)
RMSE = sqrt(MSE)
RMSE
```

Note that in Math 241 you learned that the sample average is an estimate of the "mean", the population expected value of height. We will call the average the "mean" going forward since it is probably correct to the nearest tenth of an inch with this amount of data.

Run a linear model attempting to explain the childrens' height using the parents' height. Use `lm` and use the R formula notation. Compute and report $b_0$, $b_1$, RMSE and $R^2$. Use the correct units to report these quantities.

```{r}
#TO-DO
n = 928
null = mean(Galton$child)
null

y = Galton$child
x = Galton$parent
simple_linear_model = lm(y ~ x)
simple_linear_model
b_vec = coef(simple_linear_model)
b_0 = b_vec[1]
b_1 = b_vec[2]

e =simple_linear_model$residuals
SSE = sum(e^2)
MSE = SSE/(n - 2)
RMSE = sqrt(MSE)
RMSE
```

Interpret all four quantities: $b_0$, $b_1$, RMSE and $R^2$.


b_0 is the intercept and b_1 is the change in the child's height. R^2 is the percentage increase of the model performance in comparison to the null mode. RMSE is the variation on each calculation of the childs height.

How good is this model? How well does it predict? Discuss.
This model will predict 95% of the time within 4.4  




It is reasonable to assume that parents and their children have the same height? Explain why this is reasonable using basic biology and common sense.

Yes. The Parents DNA are passed down to their children. 



If they were to have the same height and any differences were just random noise with expectation 0, what would the values of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ be?

TO-DO

Let's plot (a) the data in $\mathbb{D}$ as black dots, (b) your least squares line defined by $b_0$ and $b_1$ in blue, (c) the theoretical line $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ if the parent-child height equality held in red and (d) the mean height in green.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggplot2)
ggplot(Galton, aes(x = parent, y = child)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_abline(intercept = b_0, slope = b_1, color = "blue", size = 1) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, color = "red", size = 1) +
  geom_abline(intercept = avg_height, slope = 0, color = "darkgreen", size = 1) +
  xlim(63.5, 72.5) + 
  ylim(63.5, 72.5) +
  coord_equal(ratio = 1)
```

Fill in the following sentence: 
  
  TO-DO: Children of short parents became short on average and children of tall parents became tall on average.

Why did Galton call it "Regression towards mediocrity in hereditary stature" which was later shortened to "regression to the mean"?

Galton called it "Regression towards mediocrity" because there is a likledhood of predicting the mean value of the inputs. 

Why should this effect be real?
Possibly because the low end and the high end must have equal weight.

You now have unlocked the mystery. Why is it that when modeling with $y$ continuous, everyone calls it "regression"? Write a better, more descriptive and appropriate name for building predictive models with $y$ continuous.
Linear Mean Prection

Create a dataset $\mathbb{D}$ which we call `Xy` such that the linear model as $R^2$ about 50\% and RMSE approximately 1.

```{r}
x = c(1, 10, 10)
  y = c(.10 , .6, 2)
  Xy = data.frame(x = x, y = y)
Xy = lm(y ~ x)
summary(Xy)$r.squared
summary(Xy)$sigma
```

Create a dataset $\mathbb{D}$ which we call `Xy` such that the linear model as $R^2$ about 0\% but x, y are clearly associated.

```{r}
x = c(0, 1, 2)
  y = c(0 , 1, 0)
  Xy = data.frame(x = x, y = y)
Xy = lm(y ~ x)
summary(Xy)$r.squared
summary(Xy)$sigma
```

Load up the famous iris dataset and drop the data for Species "virginica".

```{r}
#TO-DO

data(iris)

Xy = iris

Xy = as.data.frame(Xy[Xy$species != "verginica"])  
#summary(iris)
Xy
summary(Xy)
```

If the only input x is  Species and you are trying to predict y which is Petal.Length, what would a reasonable, naive prediction be under both Species? Hint: it's what we did in class.

```{r}
#TO-DO
setosa = mean((iris[iris$Species == "setosa", "Petal.Length"]))
virginica = mean((iris[iris$Species == "virginica", "Petal.Length"]))

setosa
virginica

#if the input is setosa then return the mean setosa lenths else return the mean of virginica lengths
```

Prove that this is the OLS model by fitting an appropriate `lm` and then using the predict function to verify you get the same answers as you wrote previously.

```{r}
#TO-DO
y = Xy$Petal.length
y

x = Xy$Species
x
lm(y ~ x)


```
